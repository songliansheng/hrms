## About
This is the front-end part of my self-study project - hrms - a simple CRUD web application with front-end and back-end separated , for the purpose of learning spring framework and vue.js . the back-end is [here](https://github.com/songliansheng/hrms-back-end).  

This isn't a step by step tutorial , this is source code for my personal use. 

## How to use
this project is built as a regular node.js application . Run command below to perform building tasks specified in the package.json file.
```
npm run build
```
As the front-end of a complete project , this project need to be copied to folder "src/main/resources/static" of the back-end project after the build complete.
